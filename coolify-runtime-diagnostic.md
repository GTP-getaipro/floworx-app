# üîç COOLIFY RUNTIME DIAGNOSTIC GUIDE

**Status:** Docker build successful, but application not accessible  
**Issue:** Runtime/deployment problem, not build problem  
**Symptom:** nginx welcome page instead of FloWorx application  

---

## üìä **CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS**

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ **Docker build completes successfully**
- ‚úÖ **Container image is created**
- ‚úÖ **Server infrastructure is running (nginx)**
- ‚úÖ **Domain resolves correctly (app.floworx-iq.com ‚Üí 72.60.121.93)**
- ‚úÖ **Port 80 is accessible**

### ‚ùå **What's Not Working:**
- ‚ùå **FloWorx application not accessible**
- ‚ùå **Showing nginx welcome page instead of app**
- ‚ùå **Port 443 (HTTPS) not working**
- ‚ùå **Application container not properly running/proxied**

---

## üö® **ROOT CAUSE: RUNTIME DEPLOYMENT ISSUE**

Since Docker build is successful, the problem is in the **runtime phase**:

1. **Container starts but crashes immediately**
2. **Container runs but doesn't bind to port 5001**
3. **Coolify proxy not configured to route to container**
4. **Environment variables causing runtime failure**
5. **Application startup process failing**

---

## üîç **IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS**

### **STEP 1: Check Container Status in Coolify**

1. **Go to Coolify Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to your FloWorx application**
3. **Check "Deployments" tab:**
   - Look for deployment status: ‚úÖ Success or ‚ùå Failed
   - Check deployment logs for any errors
   - Verify latest deployment is active

4. **Check "Resources" or "Containers" section:**
   - Is the container showing as "Running"?
   - What's the container status?
   - Any restart loops or crash indicators?

### **STEP 2: Check Application Logs**

1. **In Coolify Dashboard, go to "Logs" tab**
2. **Look for these specific patterns:**

   **‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ All required environment variables are set. Starting server...
   ‚úÖ Database connection initialized successfully
   ‚úÖ Authentication configuration validation passed
   info: FloworxInvite backend server started {"port":5001}
   ```

   **‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS:**
   ```
   ‚ùå Authentication configuration validation failed
   ‚ùå Database connection failed
   ‚ùå Port 5001 already in use
   ‚ùå Permission denied
   ‚ùå Container exited with code 1
   Error: Cannot find module
   ```

### **STEP 3: Check Domain & Proxy Configuration**

1. **Go to "Domains" section in Coolify**
2. **Verify app.floworx-iq.com configuration:**
   - Is domain properly configured?
   - Is SSL certificate generated?
   - Is proxy pointing to correct container?
   - Check port mapping: 80/443 ‚Üí container:5001

---

## üîß **COMMON RUNTIME ISSUES & FIXES**

### **Issue 1: Container Starts But Crashes**
**Symptoms:** Container shows as "Restarting" or "Exited"
**Causes:**
- Environment variable validation failing
- Database connection issues
- Port binding problems
- Application code errors

**Fix:**
- Check container logs for crash reason
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Test database connectivity

### **Issue 2: Container Runs But Not Accessible**
**Symptoms:** Container shows as "Running" but nginx welcome page appears
**Causes:**
- Application not binding to port 5001
- Coolify proxy not configured
- Port mapping incorrect

**Fix:**
- Verify application is listening on port 5001
- Check Coolify proxy configuration
- Restart the application service

### **Issue 3: SSL/HTTPS Not Working**
**Symptoms:** HTTP works but HTTPS doesn't
**Causes:**
- SSL certificate not generated
- Domain verification failed
- Proxy SSL configuration incorrect

**Fix:**
- Regenerate SSL certificate in Coolify
- Verify domain ownership
- Check proxy SSL settings

## üéØ **SPECIFIC ACTIONS FOR YOUR SITUATION**

### **Action 1: Check Container Logs Right Now**
```bash
# In Coolify Dashboard ‚Üí Logs tab, look for:
1. Does the container start successfully?
2. Do you see "FloworxInvite backend server started"?
3. Any error messages during startup?
4. Is the application binding to port 5001?
```

### **Action 2: Verify Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Coolify Dashboard ‚Üí Environment Variables, confirm:
SUPABASE_URL=https://enamhufwobytrfydarsz.supabase.co
JWT_SECRET=[your-jwt-secret]
SENDGRID_API_KEY=[your-sendgrid-key]
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=info@floworx-iq.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=FloWorx Team
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5001
```

### **Action 3: Check Proxy Configuration**
```bash
# In Coolify Dashboard ‚Üí Domains section:
1. Is app.floworx-iq.com configured?
2. Is SSL certificate status "Active"?
3. Is proxy pointing to your container?
4. Port mapping: 80/443 ‚Üí container:5001
```

## üöÄ **TESTING PLAN ONCE FIXED**

Once the container is properly running, I'll immediately test:

### **Quick Verification:**
```bash
curl https://app.floworx-iq.com/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

### **Comprehensive API Testing:**
```bash
node production-api-test-suite.js
# Will test all middleware, routers, and APIs
```

---

## ‚è∞ **EXPECTED RESOLUTION TIMELINE**

1. **Check container logs:** 2-3 minutes
2. **Identify specific issue:** 2-3 minutes  
3. **Apply fix (restart/reconfigure):** 3-5 minutes
4. **Verify service is working:** 2-3 minutes
5. **Run comprehensive tests:** 3-5 minutes
**Total:** 12-19 minutes

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

**RIGHT NOW:**
1. **Open Coolify Dashboard**
2. **Check container status** (Running/Stopped/Restarting?)
3. **Review container logs** for startup errors
4. **Verify domain/proxy configuration**

**SHARE WITH ME:**
- Container status (Running/Stopped/etc.)
- Any error messages from logs
- Domain configuration status
- SSL certificate status

Once I know the specific runtime issue, I can provide the exact fix and then run comprehensive testing of all middleware, routers, and APIs as requested.
