# Floworx Billing System Analysis & Design

## üìä Current State Assessment

### **Existing Billing Fields (Adequate for MVP)**
```sql
-- Current users table billing fields
trial_started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
trial_ends_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
subscription_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'trial'
```

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Basic trial management
- ‚úÖ Simple subscription status tracking
- ‚úÖ Sufficient for initial launch

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå No plan differentiation or pricing tiers
- ‚ùå No payment history or invoice tracking
- ‚ùå No usage-based billing capabilities
- ‚ùå No upgrade/downgrade path management
- ‚ùå Limited financial reporting capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Proposed Comprehensive Billing System

### **1. Subscription Plans Table**
**Purpose:** Define tiered pricing for hot tub businesses

```sql
-- Hot tub industry-specific plan features
max_email_accounts INTEGER,      -- Gmail connections
max_workflows INTEGER,           -- n8n automations  
max_team_members INTEGER,        -- Notification recipients
max_monthly_emails INTEGER,      -- Processing volume
max_business_categories INTEGER, -- Email categorization rules
```

**Business Value:**
- **Starter ($29/month):** Small shops, 1 Gmail account, basic automation
- **Professional ($79/month):** Growing businesses, AI responses, analytics
- **Enterprise ($199/month):** Large operations, CRM integration, custom branding

### **2. User Subscriptions Table**
**Purpose:** Link users to plans with lifecycle management

**Key Features:**
- Trial extension capabilities
- Billing cycle flexibility (monthly/yearly)
- Failed payment tracking
- Cancellation reason tracking
- Seamless plan upgrades/downgrades

### **3. Invoices & Line Items**
**Purpose:** Complete financial record keeping

**Compliance Benefits:**
- Detailed billing history for tax purposes
- Usage-based billing support
- Refund and credit tracking
- Integration with accounting systems

### **4. Usage Tracking System**
**Purpose:** Monitor and enforce plan limits

**Hot Tub Business Metrics:**
- `emails_processed` - Core automation metric
- `workflows_executed` - n8n workflow runs
- `team_notifications_sent` - Team alert volume
- `gmail_accounts_connected` - OAuth connections
- `business_categories_used` - Email classification rules

## üîó Integration with Existing Systems

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture Integration**
```sql
-- All billing tables include user_id with RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own subscriptions" 
ON user_subscriptions FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### **Password Reset & Security Integration**
- Billing events logged in `security_audit_log`
- Payment method changes trigger security notifications
- Subscription changes require email verification
- Failed payment attempts tracked for security monitoring

### **n8n Workflow Integration**
```sql
-- Usage tracking for workflow executions
SELECT track_usage(user_id, 'workflows_executed', 1, 
    '{"workflow_id": "abc123", "execution_time": 1.5}'::jsonb);
```

### **Onboarding Flow Enhancement**
1. **Plan Selection** - New step in onboarding wizard
