## üöÄ Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying FloWorx's enterprise-grade monitoring infrastructure to production. The system includes real-time performance monitoring, intelligent error tracking, business-driven alerting, automated stakeholder reporting, and adaptive threshold learning.

## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: Version 16.0.0 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 12 or higher
- **Memory**: Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
- **Storage**: Minimum 10GB free space
- **Network**: Outbound HTTPS access for external integrations

### Required Services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Email Service**: SMTP server for notifications
- **Optional**: N8N instance for workflow monitoring
- **Optional**: Redis for caching (recommended for high traffic)

## üîß Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Copy the production environment template:
```bash
cp .env.production.template .env.production
```

Configure the following critical settings:

#### Core Settings
```env

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/floworx_prod
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_minimum_32_chars
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key
```

#### Monitoring Thresholds
```env
MONITOR_SLOW_QUERY_MS=500
MONITOR_CRITICAL_QUERY_MS=2000
MONITOR_ERROR_RATE=0.02
MONITOR_CRITICAL_ERROR_RATE=0.05
```

#### Alert Configuration
```env

### 2. Database Setup

Create production database and user:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE floworx_production;
CREATE USER floworx_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE floworx_production TO floworx_user;
```

Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run migrate:production
```

### 3. SSL/TLS Configuration

For production deployment, ensure SSL is properly configured:
```env
SSL_ENABLED=true
SSL_CERT_PATH=/path/to/ssl/cert.pem
SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/ssl/key.pem
```

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Automated Deployment

Run the automated deployment script:
```bash
# Standard deployment
node scripts/deploy-production-monitoring.js

# Verbose output
node scripts/deploy-production-monitoring.js --verbose

# Dry run (validation only)
node scripts/deploy-production-monitoring.js --dry-run
```

### Manual Deployment Steps

If you prefer manual deployment:

#### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm ci --production
```

#### 2. Build Application
```bash
npm run build
```

#### 3. Start Services
```bash
# Start with PM2 (recommended)
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production

# Or start directly
npm run start:production
```

- ‚úÖ Tests report generation

### Phase 6: Adaptive Learning
- ‚úÖ Initializes adaptive threshold service
- ‚úÖ Configures machine learning parameters

### Phase 7: Health Validation
- ‚úÖ Performs comprehensive health checks
- ‚úÖ Validates all services
- ‚úÖ Tests alert generation

### Phase 8: Production Ready
- ‚úÖ Generates deployment summary
- ‚úÖ Sends deployment notifications
- ‚úÖ Enables production monitoring

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Service Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "database": "connected",
    "monitoring": "active",
    "alerting": "configured",
    "reporting": "scheduled"
  }
}
```

### 2. Monitoring Dashboard
Access the monitoring dashboard:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/dashboard
```

### 3. Test Alert Generation
Trigger a test alert:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/monitoring/test-alert \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Verify Reporting
Check that reports are scheduled:
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/reports/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

# Check service status
pm2 status
pm2 monit

# Restart services if needed
pm2 restart all
```
