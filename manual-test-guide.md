## 🔍 **DEBUGGING CHECKLIST**

If something doesn't work, check:

- No error messages about missing components

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The fixes are working correctly if:

1. **Registration Works**: Users can successfully create accounts
2. **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages appear as toasts
3. **Form Validation**: HTML5 validation prevents invalid submissions
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for all failure cases
5. **User Experience**: Smooth flow from registration to next step

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue: "An unexpected error occurred"**
