## 📊 **Current Deployment Status**

### **Infrastructure Validation Results**
```
🎯 DEPLOYMENT STATUS: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503)
🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS:
  ✅ DNS Resolution: RESOLVED (app.floworx-iq.com -> 72.60.121.93)
  ✅ SSL Certificate: VALID (expires Dec 7, 2025)
  ⚠️ Server Status: SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (deployment in progress)

🧪 UAT FRAMEWORK STATUS: READY
  ✅ All UAT components available and functional
  ✅ Node.js dependencies installed
  ✅ Playwright browsers configured
```

### **Deployment Analysis**
The production server is currently returning **503 Service Unavailable**, which indicates:
- ✅ **DNS & SSL**: Properly configured and working
- ⚠️ **Application Server**: Deployment in progress or service restart needed
- ✅ **UAT Framework**: Ready to execute once server is available

node uat-deployment-status.js

# Full UAT suite (when server is available)
npm run uat:production
```

### **UAT Dashboard**
```bash
# Start real-time UAT dashboard
npm run uat:dashboard
# Access at: http://localhost:3001
```

### **CI/CD Integration**
