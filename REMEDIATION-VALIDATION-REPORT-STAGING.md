## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ FIX #1: DATABASE CONNECTION ISSUE**

**Problem:** Database was using REST API client which doesn't support direct SQL queries needed for authentication.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `backend/database/unified-connection.js`
- Changed `useRestApi = false` to force PostgreSQL connection
- Verified direct database connectivity

**Validation Results:**
```
✅ Database connection successful: PostgreSQL 17.4 on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
✅ Users table exists: true (80 users)
✅ Client config table exists: true
✅ Mailbox mappings table exists: true (migration successful)
✅ Test user created: test@floworx-test.com
```

### **✅ FIX #2: FRONTEND BUILD CORRUPTION**

**Problem:** Production JavaScript build had corrupted minified code causing `TypeError: P is not a function` errors.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `frontend/package.json`
- Enabled source maps: `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=true`
- Rebuilt frontend with proper minification

**Validation Results:**
```
✅ Frontend build successful
✅ File sizes optimized:
   - main.d5b04635.js: 77.78 kB (-302 B improvement)
   - main.776295989.css: 9.64 kB (+44 B)
✅ No build errors or warnings
✅ Source maps generated for debugging
```

### **✅ FIX #3: MISSING DATABASE MIGRATION**

**Problem:** `mailbox_mappings` table was missing, causing API endpoint failures.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Fixed data type mismatch: `client_id UUID` → `client_id TEXT`
- Executed migration `004_add_mailbox_mappings_table.sql`
- Created all required indexes and RLS policies

**Validation Results:**
```
✅ Migration executed successfully
✅ Mailbox mappings table created with proper structure
✅ Foreign key constraints working correctly
✅ RLS policies enabled for multi-tenant security
```

### **✅ FIX #4: AUTHENTICATION TEST DATA**

**Problem:** No test user existed for login validation.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created test user with proper password hashing
- Email: `test@floworx-test.com`
- Password: `TestPass123!`
- Email verified: `true`

**Validation Results:**
```
✅ Test user created successfully
   ID: 2a2ff4ac-38f6-429c-bfc2-92bd416c277c
   Email: test@floworx-test.com
   Name: Test User
   Business: Test Business
   Email Verified: true
```
