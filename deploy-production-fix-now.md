# ðŸš¨ DEPLOY PRODUCTION FIX NOW - IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

## âœ… **STEP 1: COMPLETED**
- âœ… Fixed Docker port mismatch (5000 â†’ 5001)
- âœ… Fixed health check endpoint port
- âœ… Pushed to main branch (commit: accf757)

## ðŸš€ **STEP 2: DEPLOY IN COOLIFY (DO THIS NOW)**

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Open Coolify Dashboard**
   - Go to your Coolify instance
   - Navigate to your FloWorx application

2. **Force Redeploy**
   - Click **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"**
   - âœ… Check **"Force rebuild"** (important!)
   - Click **"Deploy"**

3. **Monitor Build Process**
   - Watch the **build logs** in real-time
   - Look for successful Docker build
   - Ensure no errors during build

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for complete deployment
   - Check container status shows **"Running"** (green)

## ðŸ§ª **STEP 3: TEST THE FIX**

Run this command to test:
```bash
curl -v https://app.floworx-iq.com/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-09-19T..."}
```

## ðŸ“Š **STEP 4: MONITOR SUCCESS**

### **Success Indicators:**
- âœ… HTTP 200 response from health endpoint
- âœ… Container status: "Running"
- âœ… No 503 errors
- âœ… Application accessible at https://app.floworx-iq.com

### **If Still Failing:**
1. Check Coolify build logs for errors
2. Verify container is actually running
3. Check if Coolify is using the correct Dockerfile
4. Ensure environment variables are still set

## âš¡ **CRITICAL NOTES:**

- **The fix is in the code** - just needs deployment
- **Port mismatch was the root cause** of 503 error
- **Coolify must rebuild** to pick up the Docker changes
- **Force rebuild** ensures clean deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ **EXPECTED TIMELINE:**
- **Build time**: 3-5 minutes
- **Deployment**: 1-2 minutes
- **Total**: 5-7 minutes to resolution

**ACTION REQUIRED: Go to Coolify dashboard and click "Redeploy" with "Force rebuild" NOW!**
